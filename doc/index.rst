cardinality
===========

``cardinality`` is a small Python library to determine and check the size of any
iterable (lists, iterators, generators, and so on). It is intended as a useful
companion to the built-in ``itertools`` module.


Installation
============

::

  pip install cardinality


Usage
=====

The ``cardinality`` module provides these functions:

:py:func:`cardinality.count()`

  Determines the size of an iterable.

:py:func:`cardinality.at_least()`

  checks whether an iterable has a minimum size

:py:func:`cardinality.at_most()`

  Checks whether an iterable has a maximum size.

:py:func:`cardinality.between()`

  Checks whether an iterable's size is within certain bounds.

The API docs below contain usage examples for each function.

.. note::

   These functions (at least partly) consume the iterable that is passed to it,
   so don't expect the passed iterables to be useful afterwards.


API
===

.. autofunction:: cardinality.count
.. autofunction:: cardinality.at_least
.. autofunction:: cardinality.at_most
.. autofunction:: cardinality.between
